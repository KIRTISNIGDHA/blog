Hi! I am Kirti. I have done PhD in Cancer biology and is a Health Data Science fellow at Insight.  I obtained my Bachelor's in Biotechnology and Master's in Biomedical Engineering from India. After working for one year as research assistant at IIT Kanpur, India, I moved to Ohio to pursue my  PhD. from University of Dayton. My thesis research focused on understanding role of innate immune system during tumor progression. During this time, I fell in love with data analysis and deriving meaningful insights from messy data. Currently I am working as a Data scientist and striving to further expand my understanding of disease mechanism and improve patient lives  by combining my expertise in engineering, biology and data science.

I am a keen learner and enjoy reading books and clicking photographs.
