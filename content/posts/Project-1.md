Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)  is the most common and aggressive form of brain tumor in adults (52 % of all primary brain tumors) with a poor prognosis of 12-15 months. Despite advances in the surgical and oncological treatment of GB the standard care are unable to prolong the remission and the investigative treatments introduced over past three decades have only been able to prolong the survival of patients by an average of three months. Further, these standard care put impose financial burden on the patient and the caregivers. Healthcare costs associated with GBM are extremely high. With limited resources and rising healthcare costs, it is pertinent to evaluate the not only the cost but also the value of the treatment.

Analysis of the data from  cBioportal showed genetic features play an important role in predicting prognosis. Using the machine learning algorithm, I have built a web app for the doctors to make more accurate prognosis.

 Prognostoma is a predictive tool that considers the patient demographics, genetic and medical history to predict the prognosis which can help doctor and patient make an informed decision.
